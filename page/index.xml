I&amp;rsquo;ve been building computers since 2012, and I&amp;rsquo;m currently going to school for software development, and networking. I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved working with computers, and finding new ways to do things. My homelab reflects this, and between 3 servers, and some networking equipment, I&amp;rsquo;m almost always working on something new.
My main network also doubles as the testing network at home, so a lot of this stuff involves fixing things I&amp;rsquo;ve broken.</description></item></channel></rss>
