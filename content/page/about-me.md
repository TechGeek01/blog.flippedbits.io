## About Me

I'm a tech enthusiast at heart. I've been building computers since 2012, and I'm currently going to school for software development, and networking. I've always loved working with computers, and finding new ways to do things. My homelab reflects this, and between 3 servers, and some networking equipment, I'm almost always working on something new.

My main network also doubles as the testing network at home, so a lot of this stuff involves fixing things I've broken. The good news is that I've gotten really good at learning how to fix things!

Aside from IT and homelab stuff, I tend to spend a fair bit of my free time speedcubing. It always turns heads when I'm solving something in public, and the community around it, especially at competitions, is always a fun one!
